This is so far an experiment at creating an online tool the [Cosecha Movement](http://movimientocosecha.com/). This site uses [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) as the templating framework.

## Project Specs

This is a list of how we plan to build this thing.

### Framework: Meteor.js

This is chosen because of its:
- Ease of use
- Easy to learn
- Javascript in frontend and backend
- It connects MongoDB and creates a local live-reloadable server for you

### Templating: React

Over time, this may change to React Native, but for now, we will be using React and using Cordova to make it accessible via a Android and iOS apps.

### Hosting

Need to make a decision when deployment time comes. For now there are two main options:
1. Digital Ocean
2. Modulus.io

## Timeline

This will really depend on if any people would like to join in the effort, but as of now the goal is to come out with a BETA release (something that is ready to be used) by June 17, 2016.

## Development Team

- [Celso De La Rosa Martinez](https://github.com/celsom3)
- [your-name-here]?

## Workflow

Right now the workflow is fairly simple, considering it is starting out as a team of one.

Over time, however, a more sophisticated worklow will have to be adopted. We are preparing for this by at least not committing to master and using a 'git flow' model. Basically, the plan is to make a develop branch, and from that branch create feature branches.

We don't want to commit to master, now don't we?

After the development community grows in size, we can start using more sophisticated workflows. In the meantime, I will experiment with various tools and methods, trying not to mess up the ability to look back and see what was done in the past.

## Support the Project

If you can't contribute with code, but want to contribute with other ways, here are three:

1. Become a translator
2. Become a tester
3. [Donate for server and online tools expenses](https://cash.me/$celsom3) (Celso is currently taking on these expenses) We are not a non-profit, or a business, just a group of people trying build a tool for a decentralized social justice movement, with the hopes that it can one day serve other social justice movements.
